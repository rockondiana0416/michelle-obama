                   <p>In 2015 Let Girls Learn was launched. A program to help girls worldwide to get an education. </p>
                   <ul>
                     <li>$1 Billion has been invested all around the world for girls gain equal access to a quality education.</li>
                     <li>Michelle visited the Mulberry School for Girls to speak about the oppertunities for girls when they have an education.</li>
                     <li>The Mulberry School is located in an inpoverished area of London but, they are able to keep academic development highl. And, the girls have high asperations and self- determination.</li> 
                     <li>A quote I found on <a href="https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/global_learning/2017/01/the_legacy_of_michelle_obama_and_the_let_girls_learn_campaign.html" alt="Education Week" target="_blank">Education Week</a> sums the campaign well. In Mrs. Obama's words, "There are still many causes worth sacrificing for, so much history yet to be made." And that history will be made, in part, by women empowered through the Let Girls Learn campaign.</li>
